"""The brand boundary on the JSON plane — ADR-172, accepted 2026-09-19.

Brand scoping was enforced in `app/frontend/router.py` and essentially nowhere
else: fifteen call sites there passed `brand_id`, and the JSON routers passed
it at none. Since the Jinja UI has a deletion date (ADR-170), that arrangement
did not *hold* the boundary so much as *borrow* it from a layer we are about to
delete.

The tests in this file are the wiring checks — the ones that answer "is the
rule still in force everywhere", as distinct from "does this route behave".
They are written **before** the rule exists, asserting today's trivially-true
state, so that the day one of them goes red it is the code that moved and not
the test that was adjusted to match it.

Same idiom as `test_api_guard.py`'s `test_every_json_router_carries_the_csrf_guard`
and `test_exactly_one_route_is_exempt_as_provider_signed`, and for the same
reason `policy.py:62` gives for the latter: *"A test asserts each list exactly,
so widening either is an edit somebody has to justify."*
